## Workflow
A good workflow is to work directly in this repo, branch off master, and submit your changes as a pull request.

Ideally name your branches with prefixes and descriptions, like this: [type]/[change]. A good prefix would be:

 - add/ = add a new feature
 - try/ = experimental feature, "tentatively add"
 - update/ = update an existing feature

You can pick among all the tickets.
